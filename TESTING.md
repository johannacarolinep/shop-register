# Testing of Shop Register
## Manual testing
## Validation
Code Institute's CI Python Linter was used to ensure all of project's code is compliant with Pep 8 standards.

By copying all of the code from each file into the tool, I was able to confirm there were no errors found (see screenshots below).

### Empty line at end of file
As can be seen in the screenshots from the CI Python Linter tool, each file has an empty line at the end of the file (in compliance with Pep 8 standards).
